# Proud to Develop Code of Conduct

## Everyone is welcome

We don't believe that you can include by excluding.  We welcome LGBTQIA+ people, family, friends, allies, and anyone who wants to learn more.  Our aim is to encourage inclusion, both in the workplace and across the Melbourne tech community.

In order to make our events and online spaces safe for LGBTQIA+ people, we require everyone to follow our Code of Conduct.

## Our commitment

The Code of Conduct applies to organisers and presenters as well as community members and sponsors. The organisers will hold each other accountable for breaches of the Code.

We will assist you to feel comfortable in our spaces however we can. If you feel unsafe, we’re happy to stay with you, escort you to wherever you need to go, or help you to notify security or local law enforcement of inappropriate behaviour.

## We won't tolerate stalking, harassment, or abuse

This also applies to behaviour that occurs outside our spaces, particularly when it's directed towards community members.  Unacceptable behaviour includes, but is not limited to, the following:

* Using sexualised language, making unwelcome sexual advances, inappropriate touching or groping, and other inappropriate or unwelcome sexual behaviour;
* Homophobic, biphobic, transphobic, sexist, racist, ableist, and otherwise discriminatory language;
* Personal insults, particularly those related to marginalised characteristics;
* Violence, threats of violence, or advocacy of violence towards any person or group of people;
* Posting or displaying sexually explicit or violent material;
* Posting or threatening to post other people’s personal information ('doxxing');
* Inappropriate or unwelcome physical contact, photography, or recording - you must have consent before touching, photographing, or recording people;
* Deliberate intimidation and stalking, whether online or in person;
* Sustained disruption of community events, including talks and presentations;
* Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviour.

All presentations at our events must comply with these standards.

## It's okay to talk about your identity on your own terms

We expect that there will be people at our events who are still discovering their identity.  Others may not be able to come out to everyone, or anyone at all.

It's up to you how much you feel comfortable sharing.  You don't have to tell anyone how you identify, even if they ask.  Any disclosures within our spaces are not to be shared unless the person making the disclosure gives you explicit permission to do so.

If you want to declare your pronouns, then you're welcome to do so.  If you're not ready to, that's also okay.  If you use the wrong pronouns for someone, it's good practice to correct yourself and apologise.

## Respect people's boundaries

If someone declines to be touched or photographed, or asks you to leave them alone, or asks you to stop talking about a particular topic, we expect you to comply.  Safety is more important to us than comfort, and we won't act on complaints about people setting clear boundaries.

## How to report violations

Violations of the Code of Conduct may be reported to any of the meetup’s organisers by messaging us on our Meetup page or Slack channel, or speaking to us during in-person events. If any of the organisers violates the Code of Conduct, their behaviour should be reported to one of the other organisers.

Sometimes, a person who is being harassed may not feel comfortable coming forward themselves. If you observe harassment or inappropriate behaviour directed at someone other than you, please notify the organisers using the above channels.
